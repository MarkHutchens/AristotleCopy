# Aristotle - A Binary Tutorbot

You should be able to access it in https://cosi136a-2018.slack.com/, good luck.

Below is a working script for testing purposes, used for the presentation.

>Hello there.

>Let's start with counting.

>No I don't, what's that?

>I think I understand.

>I don't get it.

>Is 1000011 equal to 131?

>Is 57 the same as 111001?

>Can we move to addition?

>Yes I do.

>Can I have an example?

>Is 11 plus 1 equal to 100?

>What is 1110 plus 11?

Since the presentation, we also have a new quiz feature. Type "Quiz me" to start it, and it should work for about two iterations. Sort of a proof-of-concept, that.
